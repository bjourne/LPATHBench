   The edges are stored as an array of pointers to arrays of edges, i.e: the edges
   from node 0 are in the array pointed to by costs[0]. This structure has two
   useful properties:
     * it allows the arrays of edge structures to be dynamically allocated, to
        maximize the density of useful data in caches
     * it achieves performance almost as good as a statically sized matrix, while
       allowing dynamic sizing

   This has only been optimised for Tegra K1, a Cortex-A15-based SoC when compiled
   with gcc 4.8.2. Performance seems highly dependent on code alignment.

   Peformance (with provided benchmark graph): around 10% speedup compared to cpp,
   and around 15% compared to C/HIGHBIT.

   Note that C/HIGHBIT has been observed to be faster on a second sparse graph with
   35 nodes.
